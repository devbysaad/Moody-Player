## 🧠 Project Overview

**Moody Player** uses your webcam to detect facial expressions like *happy*, *sad*, *neutral*, etc., using **Face API.js**, then fetches mood-specific songs from a MongoDB database through an Express backend.

It’s a smart and minimal app designed for fun, personalization, and seamless integration between AI and music.
